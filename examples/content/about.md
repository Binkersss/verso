I'm a systems developer and Masters Student at Oregon State University who loves building fast, minimal software. I spend most of my time working on:

- Distributed systems
- Performance optimization
- Low-level programming

When I'm not designing or programming you'll find me cycling the gravel forest roads of the Oregon Coast Range, splitboarding in the Oregon Cascades, or riding my skateboard for the British Downhill Skateboarding team.

Read my [Blog](notes) to hear more about my current technical and non-technical interests!

## Background

I've been programming for over 4 years, primarily in C/C++, Go, Python, and Rust. I believe in writing simple, maintainable, and composable code that does one thing well.
