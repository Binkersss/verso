## [0.0.1]

Literally everything lol.

## [v0.0.2] 

### Fixed
- **Site title configuration**: Fixed bug where the `SiteTitle` config option was not being passed to the Builder, causing the `-title` flag to be ignored. Page titles now correctly display as "Page Title - Site Title" when a site title is specified.

### Changed
- Reorganized project structure to include `examples/` directory with sample implementations for testing and reference
